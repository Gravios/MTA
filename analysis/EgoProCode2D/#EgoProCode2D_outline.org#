* Motivation
** Phenomenon
The spikes of a place cell contain information regarding the spatial position of the rat's head.
The network orchestrates sequences of place cells as oscilatory bursts in the theta frequency range (5-12Hz).
The temporal order of the place cells reflects a spatial representation that sweeps from behind to in front of the animal.

The spikes of the place cells within each sequence are ordered where early-late corresponds to behind-ahead. 
In a phenomenon referred to as phase precession, a sigle place cell's spikes will apear earlier in each 
sequence as the rat moves towards, through, and away from its place field center. 


Theta sequences
    Local sequences were observed during foraging and navigation ( Skaggs and McNaughton 1996 )

    Non-local sequences observed during immobility ( Lee and Wilson 2002) 
    
    Stationary sequences observed during inter-trial wheel runnig ( Pastalkova and Buzsaki 2008 )

A change in a rat's position in time and space is mediated through behavior.

A rat's behavior drives changes in its position and orientation over an epoch of time.

Phase precession is the phenomenon where a neuron fires at progressively 
earlier phases of theta. The neuron's change in phase is correlated with 
the rat's progression through the neuron's place field.

It was first recognized in the firing patterns of place cells 
as rats ran through the cells' place-fields. 

A place cell firing toward the ascending theta phases is associated with 
an approach to a place field; the trough: the center; 
The place cell will fire on the descending phase before the departure from 
the place field. 


The initial discovery was demonstrated on a linear track which constrained 
the rat's movement to shuttling from end to end of a straight track. The 
linear track afforded several nadvantages over a two dimensional arean. First
However, in open
field arenas with unconstrained two dimensional movement place field have a
gaussian profile.

The entrance to the place field evokes spiking at the peak of theta. Spiking 
generally terminates at the exit from the place field at around 90 degrees.

** Research
*** Linear track (o'keefe probably)
The clearest circular-linear relationship is observed on a linear track, As the
rat shuttles between ends, encouraged by water rewards at the terminals, the 
running speed is uniform and the behavior regular. 

*** Open field (skaggs,huxter)
Phase precession is also observed in 2d environments, although to observe a 
circular linear relationship between space and spike theta phase a place field
centric transformation is performed to reduce the spatial dimension from 2 
dimensions to 1. Spike distance was mapped from the placefield edges onto a
domain between -1 and 1. The transform distance's sign was assigned based the
head movement direction relative to the place field center. Negative values 
represent the movements towards the place field center, and positive 
values represent the movements away from the place field center. 

*** Circular shuttle (zugaro)
Phase precession is observed on a circular track where

** We reformulate allocentric mapping 


Hippocampal place cells have one or more randomly postioned 2D gaussian spatial 
tuning curves,. As the rat traverses through a place field
the hippocampal network coordinates the place cells' firing in sequential bursts 
on a timescale of 80 to 120 milliseconds, known as theta sequences, 
trajectory.  


During exploration the hippocampus (contains, holds,) an internal representation of the
environment, establishing 


Sensorimotor information is projected onto preconfigured maps of the hippocampal CA3 
region.

The extension of of location relative to 

The hippocampal spatial representation is centered on the head, where the majority of a
rat's sensory organs are situated, and provides the means to bind sensory information to 
the specific locations, subserving the formation, retention, and recall of episodic 
memories.





The late phase of theta, where the entorhinal cortex (EC) is the dominant input to
the CA1, via the layer lacosum moleculare, contains prospective information regarding 
the current trajectory of the rat.


An egocentric query of the allocentric location of incoming sensory information.



CA3 -> CA3 => EC2 -> CA3 =>

CA3 - CA1 => EC3 -> CA1



Hippocampal place cell activity is organized by intra- and extra-hippocampal 
network dynamics. Place cells of a rat actively engaged with its environment,
are orchestrated in rhythmic bursts at the theta frequency (6-12Hz). A single
cycle contains a sequence (i.e. theta sequence) of place cells, whose temporal
order reflects the spatial order of the place field centers along the rat's
current trajectory.

               -> timing 
                  early: CA3->CA1 
                  late : EC3->CA1




Problems:
This analysis only considers single field. 
 - How does this representation help understand multi-field place cells?
    - Each cell would require an egocentric rate map for each field




We analyze the two dimensional phase precession in an egocentric frame of reference.
We examine the egocentric phase precession correlates of head-body orientation and movement.

** Embodiment determines the locus of agency
An entity's embodiment directs its agency, in such that a configuration of an entity's sensory organs determines a
sensorial subspace within which attention may be directed, and thus constraining the geometry of the sensory view
in space around the agent, with which it associates the singularity, or "self", within its memories and 
current attention.

** Sensory and Mnemonic priming 
Rememberance of an event may be limited by the current sensorimotor state, such that the current attetional
models restrict their responsiveness to any sensory memories and modes of sensation that said sensorimotor 
state is best tuned. 

** Evolotionary Considerations
Sensorimotor states reflect a dynamic pattern of investigation that may be phasic or rhythmic but must be 
stereotypical within the entity's species (phylogenetic neighbourhood). While a specific behavior may be 
evoked, over the course of a unique event within an entity's lifetime, by a specific juxtaposition of 
external and internal configurations. The most basic of such emergent phenomena are reflexes 






* Methods
** Electrophisiolgy ( see Project BehaviorPlaceCode )
** Motion Capture   ( see Project BehaviorPlaceCode )


** Head Basis Vector 
The head basis vector represents the forward and horizontal directions relative to the head. The forward 
vector was computed as the unit vector originating at the center of the head to the front marker, and the 
horizontal vector was computed as the unit vector originating at the center of the head to the right marker.

** Head Body Angle (HBA)
The head body angle (HBA) was computed by calulating the angles of the head vector and the body vector
relative to the room and then taking their circular difference. 

** Head Forward Velocity (HVF)
The head forward velocity (HVF) was computed by smoothing the trajectory of the head with a low pass 
filter with a cut-off of 2.5 Hz and computing the head velocity with respect to the room. The velocity 
was then projected onto the head basis vector to obtain the foward and lateral speeds of the head relative
to the head.


** Unit Selection
Place cells were selected with the following criteria
 - it must express at least one place field in the arena
    - the place field must be at least 20cm from any other field in the case of a place cell with multiple fields.
    - the place field must have a maximum firing rate greater than 2 Hz.



** Allocentric rate maps ( see Project BehaviorPlaceCode )
** Egocentric rate maps
The egocentric rate maps were computed in the same manner as the allocentric rate maps, except for a change 
in reference. The head's position was substracted from the place field center at each timepoint and projected
onto head basis vector The trajectory of the place field center relative
to the head was then use to compute the occupancy within the head's frame of reference.

Collect tp-ego-ratemaps' max rate.

The computation of a place field's ratemap is an incomplete representation of the firing characteristics.
The phase of theta at which a spike occurs is tightly coupled to the position and orientation of the subject.

In the head frame of reference the place field size is on average greater on the ascending than that of 
the descending and trough phases of theta.

The ascending phase is generally theorized to be coding the posible future locations of the rat.
If this is probabilistic in nature, what information (e.g. proprioceptive and vestibular) is driving upstream 
models of the rats trajectory is necessary? and how is this information integrated? Does it truely reflect
a probalistic model of the future trajectory?

IF not ...
    ... 


Would decoding from more narrow tuning curves, or those derived from theta-trough spikes beter
reflect the allo-centric tuning curve.
