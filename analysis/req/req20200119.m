* spatial representation within the hippocampal CA1


The hippocampus is postulated to map an environment during exploration. 
* Hippocampus
** CA1
*** Neuron Types
**** pyramidal cells
**** interneurons
***** Parvalbumin basket cells (PV)
***** Somatostatin 

*** Network
\paragraph
Once an environment is explored, CA1 princi
*** Place Cells (PC)
*** CA1 principal cells emit action potentials within spatially restricted regions of an environment
*** AP emission rates are generally below 
(PC , theta) -> place field restricted activity 
(PC , LIA)   -> high 

        

The dominate variables influencing lateral phase precession are lateral head locomotion and head to body 
yaw
** CA3
** DG
